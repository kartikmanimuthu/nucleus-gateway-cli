# Nucleus Gateway CLI

**Nucleus Gateway CLI** is a versatile, code-free reverse proxy server tool encapsulated as a command-line interface (CLI), specifically tailored to enhance local microservices-based development environments.

Born out of a need to simplify the orchestration of multiple microservices, this CLI tool operates seamlessly in the background as a daemon, contributing to a clean and distraction-free workspace. It enhances usability by being service-agnostic, allowing flexibility across various service configurations.

The tool boosts productivity by handling the intricacies of traffic routing, allowing developers to concentrate on coding. Its implementation draws inspiration from Express Gateway, but with a more minimalistic design requiring less configuration. Incorporating CLI for Nucleus Gateway into your workflow will significantly streamline processes, reduce complexities, and bolster productivity. For developers navigating a microservices-based local setup, this tool is indispensable.
